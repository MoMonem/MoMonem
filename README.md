## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a software engineer on the hunt for a challenge - something that will help me grow my skills and give me a chance to work on medium to large-scale apps.

I always have a lot of questions and I'm constantly trying to learn new, useful things by taking on new challenges.
