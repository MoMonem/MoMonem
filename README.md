## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a software engineer who loves creating things from the ground up. I'm equally comfortable with frontend and backend technologies but would love to specialize in backend engineering in the future ðŸš€ 

I always have a lot of questions and I'm constantly trying to learn new, useful things by taking on new challenges.
